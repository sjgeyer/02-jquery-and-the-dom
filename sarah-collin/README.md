**Author**: Sarah & Collin
**Version**: 1.1.0 (increment the patch/fix version number up if you make more commits past your first submission)

## Overview
This application is a constructor for articles. It takes raw data supplied in a javascript file and populates an HTML page with that data, which was previously organized by another javascript file. 

## Getting Started
The user must feed raw data into the javascript file designated for this purpose, and then the program will do the rest of the work.

## Architecture
We are using the JQuery library in order to reference and traverse the DOM with greater ease and facility. We also use HTML and CSS and Javascript.
